A device tree blob (.dtb) file is compiled from multiple device tree source 
(.dts and .dtsi) files. We can decompile it into one "combined" dts file to
 reflect the actual status read by Linux kernel.
Install device tree compiler tool
On Ubuntu, device tree compiler tool can be installed with following command:

$sudo apt-get install device-tree-compiler

After installation, you should find the tool at /usr/bin/dtc
Decompile a .dtb file
Use following command to decompile:
$dtc -I dtb /path/to/your/dtb/file -O dts -o /path/to/decompiled/dts/file
For example, you can use following command to decompile the malamute/dane dtb
 file:

$dtc -I dtb out/target/product/msm8974/obj/KERNEL_OBJ/arch/arm/boot/msm8974pro-ab-pm8941-marsala.dtb -O dts -o marsala_decompiled.dts


For more details on usage of dtc, please refer to output of "man dtc"
